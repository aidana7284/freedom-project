The freedom project is a project designed for us to make an informative website based on a topic we have researched thoroughly and are hopefully interested in. The purpose of the project is to use the numerous web design features we have learned over the course of the year in HTML and CSS and to use the information we gathered on our topic in an informative website to help teach other people about the topic. The topics that my website will be about are Serial killers and forensics. In my project I cover evidence analysis, a dive into the minds of serial killers and some basic forensics info.
