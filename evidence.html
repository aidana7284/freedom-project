<h1> Evidence analysis and DNA evidence</h1>
<h4> Evidence analysis and DNA evidence are a massive part of modern day crime solving. DNA evidence is a relatively new way of being able to identify both potential murders and victims. Often if someone has DNA at the crime scene they were somehow involved in the crime. DNA evidence has also been used many times to free wrongfully convicted people by showing that either someone elses DNA was at the crime scene or that theirs wasn't. DNA evidence and evidence analysis often go hand in hand since alot of the evidence anaylysed is normally DNA based. Evidence analysis is still needed using DNA evidence to determine if someone is just a victim or perpatraitor. DNA evidence is also helpful in determining if a spree of killings is by the same person or therefore a serial killer. If the same unkown persons DNA is found on many different murder victims that likely means a serial killer is on the loose
