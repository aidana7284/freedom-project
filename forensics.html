  <br>
  <p class="text"> Forensics is the science of crime solving. Forensic science often is used to either find a suspect or, find out wether a crime has occured or not. Forensic scientist uses tools such as DNA analysis in order to match the DNA of an unidentified victim to a person on record or to match a potential suspect to any DNA found in the crime scene. Forensic science also uses blood splatter analysis which when analysed in a violent stabbing a detective or scientist would be able to determine the type of weapon, wether the perpatraitor was left or right handed and where they were standing in the room or outdoors during the crime. These crime solving methods are detremental to crime solving and have helped both clear innocent peoples records and incarcerate guilty people.
