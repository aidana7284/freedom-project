  <h1> Mind of a Serial Killer </h1>
  <h4> Serial killers often have mental traits such as pyscopathy, extreme paranoid scizonphrenia or sociopathy. Pyscopathy often makes the person who has it feel less or no remorse for their actions as well as making them more likely to be angry and prone to fits of rage. Paranoid scizonphrenia will lead someone to believe outside sources are trying to hurt them or kill them and they will often have paranoid dellusions relating to those ideas. sociopaths often feel less or no emotion meaning they often have little to no conscious and don't feel remorse for their actions. These traits are all things that if severe enough could create a serial killer.</h4>
